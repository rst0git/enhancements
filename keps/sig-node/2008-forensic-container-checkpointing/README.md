## Summary

Provide an interface to trigger a container checkpoint for forensic analysis.

## Motivation

Container checkpointing provides the functionality to take a snapshot of a
running container. The checkpointed container can be transferred to another
node and the original container will never know that it was checkpointed.

Restoring the container in a sandboxed environment provides a mean to
forensically analyse a copy of the container to understand if it might
have been a possible threat. As the analysis is happening on a copy of
the original container a possible attacker of the original container
will not be aware of any sandboxed analysis.

### Goals

The goal of this KEP is to introduce *checkpoint* to the CRI API.
This includes extending the *kubelet* API to support checkpointing single
containers with the forensic use case in mind.

### Non-Goals

Although *checkpoint* and *restore* can be used to implement container
migration this KEP is only about enabling the forensic use case. Checkpointing
a pod is not part of this proposal and left for future enhancements.

## Proposal

### Implementation

For the forensic use case we want to offer the functionality to checkpoint a
container out of a running Pod without stopping the checkpointed container or
letting the container know that it was checkpointed.

The corresponding code changes for the forensic use case can be found in the
following pull request:

* https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104907

The goal is to introduce *checkpoint* and *restore* in a bottom-up approach.
In a first step we only want to extend the CRI API to trigger a checkpoint
by the container engine and to have the low level primitives in the *kubelet*
to trigger a checkpoint. It is necessary to enable the feature gate
`ContainerCheckpoint` to be able to checkpoint containers.

In the corresponding pull request a checkpoint is triggered using the *kubelet*
API:

```
curl -skv -X POST "https://localhost:10250/checkpoint/default/counters/wildfly"
```

For the first implementation we do not want to support restore in the
*kubelet*. With the focus on the forensic use case the restore should happen
outside of Kubernetes. The restore is a container engine only operation
in this first step.

#### CRI Updates

The CRI API will be extended to introduce one new RPC:
```
    // CheckpointContainer checkpoints a container
    rpc CheckpointContainer(CheckpointContainerRequest) returns (CheckpointContainerResponse) {}
```
with the following parameters:
```
message CheckpointContainerRequest {
    // ID of the container to be checkpointed.
    string container_id = 1;
    // Location of the checkpoint archive used for export/import
    string location = 2;
}

message CheckpointContainerResponse {}
```

### User Stories

For the initial Alpha release this KEP was focusing on "Forensic Container
Checkpointing". The checkpoint/restore technology, however, opens up the
possibility to many different use cases. Since the introduction in Kubernetes
1.25 there has been feedback from users that were using the checkpoint
functionality for some of those other use cases. In the following some
of the possible use cases are described starting with the original
"Forensic Container Checkpointing" use case. At which point any of these
use cases will be supported in Kubernetes is not defined yet. At this point
any of the use cases can be used with the currently available implementation.
One question for the future will be in how far any of the possible use cases can
be made more user friendly by additional Kubernetes features.  Especially the
container migration use case has many possibilities for optimization. CRIU,
which is on the lowest level of the checkpoint/restore stack, offers the
possibility to decrease container downtime during migration by techniques well
known in virtual machine migration like pre-copy or post-copy migration.

#### Forensic Container Checkpointing

To analyze unusual activities in a container, the container should
be checkpointed without stopping the container or without the container
knowing it was checkpointed. Using checkpointing it is possible to take
a copy of a running container for forensic analysis. The container will
continue to run without knowing a copy was created. This copy can then
be restored in another (sandboxed) environment in the context of another
container engine for detailed analysis of a possible attack.

#### Fast Container Startup

In addition to forensic analysis of a container checkpointing can be used to
offer a way to quickly start containers. This is especially useful for
containers that need a long time start. Either the software in the container
needs a long time to initialize by loading many libraries or the container
requires time to read data from a storage device. Using checkpointing it is
possible to wait once until the container finished the initialization and save
the initialized state to a checkpoint archive. Based on this checkpoint archive
one or multiple copies of the container can be created without the need to wait
for the initialization to finish. The startup time is reduced to the time
necessary to read back all memory pages to their previous location.

This feature is already used in production to decrease startup time of
containers.

Another similar use case for quicker starting containers has been reported in
combination with persistent memory systems. The combination of checkpointed
containers and persistent memory systems can reduce startup time after a reboot
tremendously.

#### Container Migration

One of the main use cases for checkpointing and restoring containers is
container migration. An open issue asking for container migration in
Kubernetes exists since 2015: [#3949][migration-issue].

With the current Alpha based implementation container migration is already
possible as documented in [Forensic Container Checkpointing Alpha][kubernetes-blog-post].

The following tries to give an overview of possible use cases for
container migration.

##### Fault Tolerance

Container migration for fault tolerance is one of the typical reasons to
migrate containers or processes. It is a well researched topic especially
in the field of high performance computing (HPC). To avoid loss of work
already done by a container the container is migrated to another node before
the current node crashes. There are many scientific papers describing how
to detect a node that might soon have a hardware problem. The main goal
of using container migration for fault tolerance is to avoid loss of already
done work. This is, in contrast to the forensic container checkpointing use
case, only useful for stateful containers.

##### Load Balancing

Container migration for load balancing is something where checkpoint/restore
as implemented by CRIU is already used in production today. A prominent example
is Google as presented at the Linux Plumbers conference in 2018:
[Task Migration at Scale Using CRIU]<[task-migration]>

If multiple containers are running on the same physical node in a cluster,
checkpoint/restore, and thus container migration, open up the possibility
of migrating containers across cluster nodes in case there are not enough
computational resources (e.g., CPU, memory) available on the current node.
While high-priority workloads can continue to run on the same node, containers
with lower priority can be migrated. This way, stateful applications with low
priority can continue to run on a different node without loosing their progress
or state.

This functionality is especially valuable in distributed infrastructure services
for AI workloads, as it helps reduce the cost of AI by maximizing the aggregate
useful throughput on a given pool with a fixed capacity of hardware accelerators.
Microsoft's globally distributed scheduling service, [Singularity]<[singularity]>,
is an example that demonstrates the efficiency and reliability of this mechanism
with deep learning training and inference workloads.

##### Spot Instances

Yet another possible use case where checkpoint/restore is already used today
are spot instances. Spot instances are usually resources that are cheaper but
with the drawback that they might shut down with very short notice. With the
help of checkpoint/restore workloads on spot instances can either be
checkpointed regularly or the checkpointing can be triggered by a signal.
Once checkpointed the container can be moved to another instance and
continue to run without having to start from the beginning.

##### Scheduler Integration

All of the above-mentioned container migration use cases currently require manual
checkpointing, manual transfer of the checkpoint archive, and manual restoration
of the container (see [Forensic Container Checkpointing Alpha][kubernetes-blog-post]
for details). If all these steps could be automatically performed by the scheduler,
it would greatly improve the user experience and enable more efficient resource
utilization. For example, the scheduler could transparently checkpoint, preempt,
and migrate workloads across nodes while keeping track of available resources and
identifying suitable nodes (with compatible hardware accelerators) where a container
can be migrated. However, scheduler integration is likely to be implemented at a later
stage and is a subject for future enhancements.

### Risks and Mitigations

In its first implementation the risks are low as it tries to be a CRI API change
with minimal changes to the kubelet and it is gated by the feature
gate `ContainerCheckpoint`.

## Design Details

The feature gate `ContainerCheckpoint` will ensure that the API
graduation can be done in the standard Kubernetes way.

A kubelet API to trigger the checkpointing of a container will be
introduced as described in [Implementation](#implementation).

Also see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104907 for details.

### Future Enhancements

The initial implementation is only about checkpointing specific containers
out of a pod. In future versions we probably want to support checkpointing
complete pods. To checkpoint a complete pod the expectation on the container
engine would be to do a pod level cgroup freeze before checkpointing the
containers in the pod to ensure that all containers are checkpointed at the
same point in time and that the containers do not keep running while other
containers in the pod are checkpointed.

One possible result of being able to checkpoint and restore containers and pods
might be the possibility to migrate containers and pods in the future as
discussed in [#3949][migration-issue].

#### Checkpoint Archive Management

One of the questions from users has been what happens with old checkpoint archives.
Especially if there are multiple checkpoints on a single node theses checkpoint
archives can occupy node local disk space. Depending on the checkpoint archive size
this could result in a situation where the node runs out of local disk space.

One approach to avoid out of disk space situations would be some kind of
checkpoint archive management or garbage collection of old checkpoint archives.

One possible argument against checkpoint archive management could be that, especially
for the forensic use case, once the checkpoint archive has been created the user should
retrieve it from the node and delete it. As there are, however, many different use
cases for container checkpointing it sounds more realistic to have an existing checkpoint
archive management to automatically clean up old checkpoint archives.

In its simplest form a checkpoint archive management could just start deleting checkpoint
archives once the number of checkpoints reaches a certain threshold. If more checkpoint
archives than the configurable threshold exist older checkpoint archives are deleted (see [#115888][checkpoint-management]).

Another way to manage checkpoint archives would be to delete checkpoint archives once
a certain amount disk space is used or if not enough free space is available.

A third way to manage checkpoint archives would be the possibility to keep one checkpoint
archive per day/week/month. The way to manage checkpoint archives probably depends on
the checkpointing use case. For the forensic use case other checkpoint archives might
be of interest in contrast to checkpointing and restoring containers in combination
with spot instances where probably only the latest checkpoint is of interest to
be able to continue preempted work.

#### CLI (kubectl) Integration

The current (Alpha) implementation only offers access to the checkpoint functionality
through the *kubelet* API endpoint. A more user friendly interface would be a *kubectl*
integration. As of this writing a pull request adding the *checkpoint* verb to
*kubectl* exists: [#120898][kubectl-checkpoint]

#### Checkpoint Options

The current (Alpha) implementation does not allow additional checkpoint parameters to be
passed to CRIU. During the integration of checkpoint/restore in other container projects
(CRI-O, Docker, Podman, runc, crun, lxc) many CRIU specific options were exposed to the user.
Common options are things like handle TCP established connections (`--tcp-established`),
stop container after checkpointing, use pre-copy or post-copy algorithms to decrease
container downtime during migration or compression method of the checkpoint archive (currently
uncompressed but things like zstd or gzip possible).

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*
The goal is to ensure that we don't accept enhancements with inadequate testing.
All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.
[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

<!--
Based on reviewers feedback describe what additional tests need to be added prior
implementing this enhancement to ensure the enhancements have also solid foundations.
-->

##### Unit tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.
-->

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>
The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit
This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.

##### Integration tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.
For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html
-->

- CRI API changes need to be implemented by at least one
  container engine

##### e2e tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.
For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html
We expect no non-infra related flakes in the last month as a GA graduation criteria.
-->

- Alpha will include e2e tests with the expectation that
  no CRI implementation provides the newly added RPC calls.
  Once CRI implementation provide the relevant RPC calls
  the e2e tests will not fail but need to be extended.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [x] Feature gate
  - Feature gate name: `ContainerCheckpoint`

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes. By disabling the feature gate `ContainerCheckpoint` again.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

Checkpointing containers will be possible again.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

Currently no.

### Dependencies

CRIU needs to be installed on the node, but on most distributions it is already
a dependency of runc/crun. It does not require any specific services on the
cluster.

### Scalability

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

The newly introduced CRI API call to checkpoint a container/pod will be
used by this feature. The kubelet will make the CRI API calls and it
will only be done when a checkpoint is triggered. No periodic API calls
will happen.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

No. It will only affect checkpoint CRI API calls.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

During checkpointing each memory page will be written to disk. Disk usage will increase by
the size of all memory pages in the checkpointed container. Each file in the container that
has been changed compared to the original version will also be part of the checkpoint.
Disk usage will overall increase by the used memory of the container and the changed files.
Checkpoint archive written to disk can optionally be compressed. The current implementation
does not compress the checkpoint archive on disk.

## Drawbacks

During checkpointing each memory page of the checkpointed container is written to disk
which can result in slightly lower performance because each memory page is copied
to disk. It can also result in increased disk IO operations during checkpoint
creation.

In the current CRI-O implementation the checkpoint archive is created so that only
the `root` user can access it. As the checkpoint archive contains all memory pages
a checkpoint archive can potentially contain secrets which are expected to be
in memory only.

The current CRI-O implementations handles SELinux labels as well as seccomp and restores
these setting as they were before. A possibly restored container is as secure as
before, but it is important to be careful where the checkpoint archive is stored.

During checkpointing CRIU injects parasite code into the to be checkpointed process.
On a SELinux enabled system the access to the parasite code is limited to the
label of corresponding container. On a non SELinux system it is limited to the
`root` user (which can access the process in any way).

## Alternatives

Another possibility to use checkpoint restore would be, for example, to trigger
the checkpoint by a privileged sidecar container (`CAP_SYS_ADMIN`) and do the
restore through an Init container.

The reason to integrate checkpoint restore directly into Kubernetes and not
with helpers like sidecar and init containers is that checkpointing is already,
for many years, deeply integrated into multiple container runtimes and engines
and this integration has been reliable and well tested. Going another way in
Kubernetes would make the whole process much more complicated and fragile. Not
using checkpoint and restore in Kubernetes through the existing paths of
runtimes and engines is not well known and maybe not even possible as
checkpointing and restoring is tightly integrated as it requires much
information only available by working closely with runtimes and engines.
